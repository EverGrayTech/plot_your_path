# Testing Standards

## Coverage Requirements
- Maintain minimum **90% line coverage** for all code

## Testing Tools
- **Python**: `pytest --cov`
- **TypeScript**: `vitest run --coverage`

## Test-First Principles
- Failing tests indicate broken code
- Fix the code first, not the tests
- Only update tests when requirements have changed

## Definition of Done
A task is complete only when:
- All tests pass
- Coverage requirements are met
- Code has been committed

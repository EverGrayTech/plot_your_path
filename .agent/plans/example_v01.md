# Plan: [Feature Name] Implementation

## 1. Technical Architecture
- **Impacted Files**: List files to be modified/created.
- **New Dependencies**: [e.g., `pnpm add zod`]
- **Data Models**: Define the Pydantic/TypeScript interfaces here first.

## 2. Implementation Steps (The Task List)
> **Agent Note**: Mark tasks as `[x]` as they are completed and committed.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation**
    - [ ] Create database migration for [Table].
    - [ ] Implement backend schemas in `src/models/`.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Core Logic**
    - [ ] Create FastAPI route for `POST /api/feature`.
    - [ ] Write logic for [Calculation/Action].
- [ ] **Phase 3: Frontend & Tests**
    - [ ] Create UI component in `src/components/`.
    - [ ] Run `pytest` and `vitest` to verify 90% coverage.

## 3. Known Risks
- [e.g., "Need to handle rate limits for external API."]
